        <p>Find a pet that fits your family and lifestyle. You need to ask yourself (and the people you live with!) how will a dog or cat fit into our life?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Are you an outdoor enthusiast and want to take your best furry bud with you?  Find a dog that will be able to take long hikes, sleep in a tent, hang out in the canoe. Sometimes you can train a cat to do these things too, but we don't recommend it as a starting point!</li>
            <li>Do you live in a small space, like an apartment? A smaller breed of dog or a cat might be easier to live with.</li>
            <li>Are you away from home all day? Some breeds of dogs have eparation anxiety, especially those that end up in shelters. The last thing you want is to learn from your neighbors that your dogs is whining and barking all day while you are gone.</li>
            <li>Do you like a lot of quiet time? A cat, who will likely be very independent, might be the perfect new companion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Think about the life you live now and how your new dog or cat will fit into it and what changes you will have to make to accommodate this new family member. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a new pet:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Energy Level - of you and the pet</li>
            <li>Size when fully grown</li>
            <li>Relating to other animals and children</li>
            <li>Noise level of the pet</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ensure everyone knows who is responsible for the care of your pet.  If it's just you, make sure you are ready to handle everything on your own.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Who will feed them?</li>
            <li>Who will clean-up after them?</li>
            <li>Who will check in on them during the day?</li>
            <li>Who will ensure they get lots of daily exercise?</li>
        </ul>
    </>

        <p>If possible, schedule a time to go to the breeder or the shelter and play with the dog or cat you researched online. It's also smart to ask the staff at the shelter about the animals you are meeting.  They will know more about their personality and temperament as well as any history you need to know.</p>

        <p>Spending time with them in advance gives you a chance to see if they warm up to you as well.  Remember, this is a multi-year relationship that will grow from this first meeting into a deep, loving bond.  It's worth taking the time to ensure it's a good fit for both of you.</p>

        <p><b>For a dog</b>, set up a crate that can become their special space that includes a bed, blanket, and toys.</p>

        <p><b>For a cat</b>, set up a small, enclosed area that includes their litter box and fresh litter, food and water, and perhaps a bed, even though they will likely assume anyplace they sleep is "their" bed.</p>

        <p>Be sure to include something from the shelter or breeder to put into that space as well. Something that smells familiar will help them settle into this strange new space called your home. You can also use a pheromone wall plug-in to help keep them calm while they settle in.</p>

        <p>Put away cleaning supplies and poisons in places they cannot access.  And remove valuables and small items they can choke on or will find too enticing to leave alone. Slippers, shoes, socks, eye glasses and anything that smells like you is fair game for your new furry pal.</p>

        <p>Buy them their own doggie chew toys and catnip stuffies to chew on and train them to stay away from chewing on your socks and pens.</p>

        <p>Since your new dog will likely come home with a starter bag of food that the shelter or breeder has been feeding them, it's a good idea to buy a small bag of that same food.  If you want to keep them on the same food, buy a bigger bag so you don't run out as quickly. If you want to transition them to a different food, buy a smaller bag of the food they eat now and transition them slowly to their new food.</p>

        <p>Choosing a vet is a very personal thing, like choosing your doctor.  Think about what kind of experience you want for yourself and your furry pal. If you like a bigger vet clinic with a more well known name, you may find it easier to get an appointment, but may not know the vet who will meet with you.  If you prefer to make a relationship with one vet, find a smaller clinic nearby.</p>

        <p>Consider asking your friends and family what vets they like.  Pet parents, like human parents, have passionate opinions about the care of their family members and will likely give you an honest assessment of their experience.</p>

        <p>Pet insurance, while not widely known in the US, is an excellent way to lower the cost of caring for a pet. Plans range from about $10 per month for plans with less coverage to $80 per month for more comprehensive plans. One of the main benefits of pet insurance is to help pay for unexpected illness or injury, which can quickly become very expensive.</p>

        <p>Our friends at Pawlicy have a terrific blog post that outlines the pros and cons of pet insurance from a veterinarian's perspective. Keep in mind that you are looking for the best plan to save you money and ensure your new furry family member gets care when they need it without hurting your wallet. Investopedia and Consumer Advocates also offer excellent comparisons of the top pet insurance companies in the US.</p>

        <p>Training is an ongoing process that continues after the classes end. Just like with a kid who is constantly pushing boundaries, a pet that is allowed to run wild, will eventually learn that this is the norm and happily continue this behavior.</p>

        <p>Another important aspect of training is that it must include every human who lives in the house, especially children, who must find a way to communicate with your pets so the pet listens to them as well.</p>

        <p>How will you find a trainer near you?  We're so glad you asked!  Check out:</p>
